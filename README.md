# RL-Algos

My approach to the commonly used Reinforcement Learning Algos, just to get an idea of their working
1. Dynamic Programming(DP)
2. MonteCarlo Method
3. Temporal Difference(TD) TD(0)
4. TD+MC TD(Lambda)
5. SARSA
6. Q_learning
7. Deep Q-Network
8. REINFORCE
9. ACTOR-CRITIC
10. A2C
11. A3C
12. PPO
